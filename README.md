INVOICE DETAILS PROJECT


Use-case/ problem statement - extract invoice details. 

Develop a process using the Modern Design Experience that automates the extraction of invoice details. The process should be capable of performing the following actions: 

Read an input Excel file with the invoice numbers. 
Sign in to the ACME website. 
Navigate to the invoice search page. 
For each invoice number in the Excel file, search for the invoice number. 
Extract the invoice details, including Vendor Tax ID, Invoice Item, Total, and Date. 
Write the extracted invoice details to an Excel file stored in the project folder. 


Please make sure you add your credentials to the "Username" and "Password" fields in the respective activities.


If you run the process without changing the invoice numbers in the "VendorID_Input" Excel file with your login credentials,
you'll receive an error message "No invoices based on your criteria could be found" from the ACME page, and the automation will fail.
